First of all, 
I would like to express my deep gratitude to Dr. Recski Gábor for his guidance not just through this thesis, but through my whole master studies. I would like to thank him for introducing me to this interesting and amazing research field. He was always flexible and available for all my questions. I thank him for his valuable advices just about any topic imaginable.  

I am also thankful to Dr. Kornai András for his constant support
and help with my work. I thank him for his energy to discuss any of problems I have.

I also would like to thank to my colleague Gémes Kinga for her excellent work. 

Finally, a special thanks to my girlfriend for her constant love and support. I thank her for her supporting me even through difficult situations. Without her, I would not have been able to write this thesis.
